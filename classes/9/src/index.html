        <h2>CHAPTER I. Down to the Rabbit-Hole</h2>
        <p>
            H<sub>2</sub>O м<sup>3</sup>

            <b>Alice</b> was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her
            sister on the bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she
            had peeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had no
            pictures or conversations in it,
            <mark>“and what is the use of a book,”</mark> thought Alice
            <strong>“without pictures or conversations?”</strong>
        </p>

        <p>
            <u>So she was considering</u> in her own mind (as well as she could,
            for the hot day made her <s>feel very sleepy and stupid</s>),
            whether the pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth the
            trouble of getting up and picking the daisies, when suddenly a White
            Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her.
        </p>

        <p>
            There was nothing <span>so very</span> remarkable in that; nor did
            Alice think it so <em>very</em> much out of the way to hear the
            Rabbit say to itself, “Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall be late!” (when she
            thought it over afterwards, it occurred to her that she ought to
            have wondered at this, but at the time it all seemed quite natural);
            but when the Rabbit actually
            <i>took a watch out of its waistcoat-pocket</i>, and looked at it,
            and then hurried on, Alice started to her feet, for it flashed
            across her mind that she had never before seen a rabbit with either
            a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to take out of it, and burning with
            curiosity, she ran across the field after it, and fortunately was
            just in time to see it pop down a large rabbit-hole under the hedge.
